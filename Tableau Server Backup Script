# Hi All, Hope the below mentioned steps will help you to setup the tableau Server Back up and House Keeping activity. Below mentioned code will help you to:
# 1. Collect and save Daily Backup
# 2. Store a copy of the backup file to Network location (another Server)
# 3. Delete the Historical file (Older than 4 days), to save the space on current drive/system
# 4. Save the script named as as Server_Backup.ps1 (Powershell script) and scheduled it using Task scheduler to run during Off-peak hours
# Please make sure you have Folder name "Server_Backup" created under "D" drive. You can change the location based on your feasibility.
# Note: I have installed the Backup under "C" drive, please updat the location if you saved it under different location. My backup file storage location is: C:\Tableau\Tableau Server\data\tabsvc\files\backups\"
